title: 'Refresh Access Token'
openapi: 'GET /v2/quecauth/accessKeyAuthrize/refreshToken'
---

Refresh your JWT access token to extend its validity. Tokens are valid for 2 hours, and it's recommended to refresh them every hour to ensure continuous access.

## No Authentication Required

This endpoint does not require authentication as it uses the refresh token to obtain a new access token.

## Token Refresh Rules

- If the token has been refreshed within the last 30 minutes or was created within the last 30 minutes, the original token is returned
- If the user or AccessKey is disabled, the refresh will fail and the original token will be disabled

## Example Usage

Refresh an existing token:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://iot-api.acceleronix.io/v2/quecauth/accessKeyAuthrize/refreshToken?grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

With specific scope:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://iot-api.acceleronix.io/v2/quecauth/accessKeyAuthrize/refreshToken?grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN&scope=userinfo" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
