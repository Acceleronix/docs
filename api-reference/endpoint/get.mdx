title: 'Get Product TSL Model'
openapi: 'GET /v2/quectsl/openapi/product/export/tslFile'
---

This endpoint retrieves the Thing Specification Language (TSL) model for a product, which defines the properties, services, and events that devices of this product type support.

## Authentication Required

This endpoint requires a valid QJWT access token obtained through the authentication API. 

**How to use in API Playground**:
1. Copy your complete access token from the authentication response
2. Paste it directly into the "Authorization" field in the API playground
3. The token should start with "QJWT" and include the full JWT string

**Token Format**: `QJWT xxxx`

**⚠️ Important**: 
- Use the complete token including the "QJWT" prefix
- Do NOT add "Bearer" or any other prefix
- Simply copy and paste the entire access_token value

## Example Usage

Get TSL model for a specific product:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://iot-api.acceleronix.io/v2/quectsl/openapi/product/export/tslFile?productKey=YOUR_PRODUCT_KEY&language=EN" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_COMPLETE_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Troubleshooting 401 "token not exists" error**:
1. **Use complete token**: Include "QJWT" prefix without "Bearer"
2. **Check token expiry**: Token expires in 24 hours (86400 seconds)  
3. **Verify product authorization**: Ensure your SaaS app has access to the specified product
4. **Check product key**: Verify the productKey exists and is accessible
